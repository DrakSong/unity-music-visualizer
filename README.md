# Unity Music Visualizer Basic Project 2018

Here is a simple project that show you how you can use native Unity features to create  music visualizer. I personally use this to create my music videos for Youtube. For sure, i have already improved that basic project a little and modified it for myself. But to get you in the right direction, i uploaded it for free here on GitHub. MIT License for sure, so use it however you want.

You can find a ready to use binary download for windows in the releases section. This is the improved version but it also contains a little watermark.

If you want donate a few bucks for my work, feel free to check this out: https://paypal.me/brainfoolong
